# Final_Project
Final Advanced JS Project - Blog

Project spec: Blog/Wiki

A simple blog is always a good test of a web-based programming language. You can use any backing storage that you want for this, but the sqlite3 module may be a good place to start. Think of this as your chance to write the kind of CMS that you've always wanted, free from the legacy problems of WordPress and other systems.
